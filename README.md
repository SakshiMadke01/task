Create a PHP application in which:

A user enters their username and password, which are static for ease of use.

used a session to save the user's username after a successful login.

A cookie for the user's username is set when they select the "Remember Me" option, saving them from having to log in again if the cookie already exists.
Destroy the session and remove the cookie when logging out.
